		<h1>Extending Modal Analysis to Nonlinear Systems</h1>
		</div><!--title-->
		
		<p><a href="index.html" style="text-decoration: none;">&larr; Previous Topic: Linear Modal Analysis</a>. </p>

		<h2> Generalized Modal Coordinates</h2>
		<p>So, is the a way to extend modal analysis to nonlinear systems? There is, and addressing that question is the purpose of this 
		website. The method discussed on this site applies to linear and nonlinear systems and reduces directly to classical modal
		analysis for linear systems. I refer to this approach as generalized modal analysis or GMA.</p> 
		
		<div class="box-right" style="margin-top: 0em; width: 520px;">
		<h1>Definition</h1>
		<b>Generalized Modal Coordinate</b> - A function $q(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ that when used as a coordinate for a system of ODEs results in a 
		decoupled ODE of the form ${dq}/{dt} = h(q)$ where $h(q)$ is any function of $q$ alone.
		</div><!--box-right-->

		<p>For nonlinear systems, the definition
		of modal analysis has to be generalized. A set of modal coordinates which decouple the system of ODEs is still the objective. 
		However the definition of a modal coordinate is generalized.</p>
		
		<p> First we drop the restriction that the function be a linear function - any function which decouples the system of ODEs will be
		allowed. Second, we relax the restriction on the form of the decoupled ODE - any decoupled ODE will be allowed. The key to calculating
		modes for a nonlinear system is to express a generalized mode in terms of the chain rule rather than using eigenvectors for the
		transformation.</p>
		
		<h3> First Order Form </h3>
		
		<p>In order to apply the chain rule to a system of ODEs, it is useful to write the system in first order form, where the term on the
		left hand side of the equation is a lone single derivative, and the term on the right contains only state variables:</p>
		
		<p>${dx_1}/{dt} = f_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br>
		${dx_2}/{dt} = f_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br>
		...<br>
		${dx_n}/{dt} = f_n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br><br>
		
		<h4> Example System </h4>
		
		<p>As an example, the same linear system will be used as on the previous page so that we can verify that we get the same linear modes. 
		However, we will also see that there are other generalized modes associated with a linear system. The linear system in first order
		form is: </p>

		<p>${dx_1}/{dt} = -2 x_1 + x_2$<br>
		   ${dx_2}/{dt} = x_1 - 2 x_2$</p>
		
		<h3> Vector Field Form</h3>
		
		<p>A closely related form that is useful for expressing the chain rule is vector field form, where $&part;/{&part; x_i}$ is used to
		represent a coordinate vector for coordinate $x_i$. This might seem like a strange notation for a basis vector if you have done
		multivariate calculus. However, there is a good reason for this notation. This is a case where the notation helps you know how
		to apply a transformation of coordinates correctly. The system of ODEs represented in vector field form is:</p>
		
		<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $V &nbsp;=&nbsp; {dx_1}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_1} + {dx_2}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_2} + ... + {dx_n}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_n}$<br>
		(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $V &nbsp;=&nbsp; f_1 &part;/{&part; x_1} + f_2 &part;/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n &part;/{&part; x_n}$</p> 

		<p>Note that when the ODE vector field is expressed in form (1), it kind of resembles the chain rule.</p>

		<h4>Example Vector Field</h4>
		
		<p>The example system in vector field form is:</p>
		
		<p>$V = (-2 x_1 + x_2) {&part;}/{&part; x_1} + (x_1 - 2 x_2) {&part;}/{&part; x_2}$</p>
		
		<h3>Coordinate Transformation</h3>

		<p>If a new coordinate function $q(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$ is defined, ${dq}/{dt}$ is calculated by:</p>
		
		<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${dq}/{dt} = V(q) = {dx_1}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + {dx_2}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + {dx_n}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} &nbsp;=&nbsp; f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n}$</p>
		
		<p> Supposed we defined a complete set of new coordinates $q_1, q_2, ... , q_n$, where these coordinate are expressed as functions of 
		$x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, and would like to represent the vector field in terms of the new coordinate system. The new vector field is calculated
		as follows:</p>
		
		<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $W = V(q_1) {&part;}/{&part; q_1} + V(q_2) {&part;}/{&part; q_2} + ... + V(q_n) {&part;}/{&part; q_n} = {dq_1}/{dt} {&part;}/{&part; q_1} + {dq_2}/{dt} {&part;}/{&part; q_2} + ... + {dq_n}/{dt} {&part;}/{&part; q_n}$</p>
		
		<p> Combining the definition of $V(q_i)$ from (3) with (4), you can see that this is the chain rule, and the the vector field notation
		make the transformation of a system of ODEs from one coordinate system more obvious. For this reason, it is a preferred notation for
		generalizing modal analysis to nonlinear systems.</p>
		
		<h3>Generalized Modal Analysis</h3>

		<p>For generalized modal analysis we combine the coordinate transformation from (3) with the decoupling condition 
		${dq}/{dt} = h(q)$.</p>
		
		<p>${dq}/{dt} = V(q) = f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} = h(q)$<br>
		$f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} = h(q)$
