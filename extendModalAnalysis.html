		As noted on <a href="index.html">this page</a> modal analysis is a choice of coordinates that de
		While the standard approach to modal analysis (using the eigenvectors as a t nonlinear systems. The problem occurs in
		step (5) because the eigenvectors of nonlinear system are not constant and cannot be brought inside the derivative, so the
		result is not a decoupled ODE.<br><br>
		
		So, is the a way to extend modal analysis to nonlinear systems? There is, and addressing that question is the purpose of this 
		website. The method discussed on this site applies to linear and nonlinear systems and reduces directly to classical modal
		analysis for linear systems. I refer to this approach as generalized modal analysis or GMA.<br><br>
		
		To generalize modal analysis, we are still interested in a choice of coordinate that decouples the system of ODEs. The following
		are some of the differences from the classical approach.<br><br>
		
		<ol>
		<li>The general rule for change of coordinates in ODEs is the chain rule. Modal analysis will be expressed in terms of the chain rule</li>
		<li>In classical modal analysis, modal equations have the decoupled form ${dq}/{dt} = &lambda; q$. In generalized modal analysis, the
		general form ${dq}/{dt} = h(q)$ will be used, where $h(q)$ is any function of $q$.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h4>The Chain Rule</h4>
		
		In order to apply the chain rule to a system of ODEs, it is useful to write the system in first order form, where the term on the
		left hand side of the equation is a lone single derivative, and the term on the right contains only state variables:<br><br>
		
		${dx_1}/{dt} = f_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br>
		${dx_2}/{dt} = f_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br>
		...<br>
		${dx_n}/{dt} = f_n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br><br>
		
		A closely related form that is useful for expressing the chain rule is vector field form, where $&part;/{&part; x_i}$ is used to
		represent a coordinate vector for coordinate $x_i$. The system of ODEs represented in vector field form is:<br><br>
		
		$V &nbsp;=&nbsp; {dx_1}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_1} + {dx_2}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_2} + ... + {dx_n}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_n} &nbsp;=&nbsp; f_1 &part;/{&part; x_1} + f_2 &part;/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n &part;/{&part; x_n}$<br><br> 
		
		If we define a new coordinate function $q(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, we can apply the chain rule to this coordinate:<br><br>
		
		${dq}/{dt} = V(q) = {dx_1}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + {dx_2}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + {dx_n}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} &nbsp;=&nbsp; f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n}$<br><br>
		
		For modal analysis we combine this with the decoupling condition ${dq}/{dt} = h(q)$.<br><br>
		
		${dq}/{dt} = V(q) = f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} = h(q)$<br>
		$f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} = h(q)$
