		Modal analysis is a powerful tool for analysis of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Modal analysis involves
		finding a set of modal coordinate which decouples a system of ODEs. A useful definition for a modal coordinate is the following:<br><br>
		
		<font size="+1"><b>Modal Coordinate definition:</b></font><br>
		<b>A modal coordinate is a linear function that when used as a coordinate results in a decoupled ODE which can be solved 
		independent of any other coordinates.</b><br><br>
		
		In essence, modal analysis converts a system that is complex to understand, because changes in one variable affect the response
		of other variables, to a system that is simple to understand, because the modal ODEs do not interact with one another and 
		the modal equations are easy to solve. The modal ODE solutions can be added to get a total system response. The power of modal
		analysis comes from the fact that you can understand the total behavior of the system in terms individual behavior of the modes.<br><br>
		
		<h4>Calculating Modal Coordinates</h4>
		Suppose we have a linear system of ODEs expressed in matrix first order form: <br><br>
		
		(1) ${dx_i}/{dt} = A_{ij} x_j$<br><br>
		
		In order for modal analysis to work, the value of the coefficients in $A_{ij}$ must not change with time. In other works, the
		coeffients can be constant values, or constant parameters such as a mass or stiffness quantity. A modal coordinate is a linear
		function, which means it can be expressed as:<br><br>
		
		(2) $q = c_i x_i$ <br><br>
		
		where $c_i$ is a vector with values that do not change with time. Lets choose the coefficients $c_i$ such that $c_i$ 
		is an eigenvector, which satisfies the equation:<br><br>
		
		(3) $c_i A_{ij} = &lambda; c_j$<br><br>
		
		This is sometimes called a left eigenvector because it is an eigenvector calculated by multiplying the matrix by a row vector on 
		the left. Now we left multiply the system of ODEs in (1) by the eigenvector $c_i$ and apply equation (3):<br><br>
		
		(4) $c_i {dx_i}/{dt} = c_i A_{ij} x_j = &lambda; c_i x_i$ <br><br>
		
		Since $c_i$ is a vector of constants, we can insert it inside the differential on the left hand side of the equation.<br><br>
		
		(5) ${d(c_i x_i)}/{dt} = &lambda; c_i x_i$ <br><br>
		
		Applying equation (2) we get the decoupled modal ODE:<br><br>
		
		(6) ${dq}/{dt} = &lambda; q$<br><br>
		
		The solution of the modal equation is:<br><br>
		
		$q = C e^{&lambda; t}$<br><br>
		
		Although it is not obvious, the the chain rule is hidden in the step above.
