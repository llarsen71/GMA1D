		Modal analysis is a powerful tool for analysis of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Modal analysis is 
		a change of coordinates that converts a multidimensional coupled system of linear ODEs to a set of decoupled ODEs 
		(or modes). In other words, it converts a system that is very complex - where changes in one variable affect others
		in complicated ways, to a system that is simple because the modes do not interact and the modal solutions can be 
		calculated relatively easily. Eigenvectors of the linear system are used to define the coordinate
		transformation that decouples the system. Modal analysis provides a good foundation for understanding the global behavior
		of a linear systems. Unfortunate the standard approach to modal analysis does not work for nonlinear systems 
		because the eigenvector transformation fails to decouple a nonlinear system of equations. <br><br>
		
		So, can modal analysis be extended to nonlinear systems? The purpose of this website is to present a natural method
		of extending modal analysis to nonlinear systems. It is worth noting that there are other approaches to extending 
		modal analysis to nonlinear systems that have significant merrit. One good example is the invariant manifold method 
		of Steven Shaw and Christophe Pierre which focuses on characterizing an important portion of the solution space 
		for a nonlinear system, but does not characterize the whole solution space in the way classical modal analysis does,
		and doesn't reduce directly to classical modal analysis. The method discussed on this site applies to linear and 
		nonlinear systems and does reduce directly to classical modal analysis. I refer to this approach as generalized 
		modal analysis or GMA.<br><br>
		
		The idea behind GMA is simple - GMA is a transformation of coordinates that converts a coupled system of differential
		equations into a set of lower dimensional decoupled (or simply coupled) ODEs. While matrix transformations are adequate
		for linear systems, the general law of transformation for differential equations is the chain rule. In fact, the
		matrix transformation used in modal analysis is an application of the chain rule (although this is not obvious).
