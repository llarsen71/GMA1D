		Modal analysis is a powerful tool for analysis of linear ordinary differential equations (ODEs). Modal analysis involves
		finding a set of modal coordinate which decouples a system of ODEs. A useful definition for a modal coordinate is the following:<br><br>
		
		<b>A modal coordinate is a linear function that when used as a coordinate results in a decoupled ODE which can be solved 
		independent of any other coordinates.</b><br><br>
		
		In essence, modal analysis converts a system that is complex to understand, because changes in one variable affect the response
		of other variables, to a system that is simple to understand, because the modal ODEs do not interact with one another and 
		the solutions to each of the modal equations can be calculated relatively easily. <br><br>
		
		Suppose we have a linear system of ODEs expressed in the first order matrix form: <br><br>
		
		(1) ${dx_i}/{dt} = A_{ij} x_j$<br><br>
		
		A modal coordinate is a linear function, which means it can be expressed as:<br><br>
		
		(2) $q = c_i x_i$ <br><br>
		
		where $c_i$ is a vector of constants. Lets choose the coefficients $c_i$ such that $c_i$ is an eigenvector, which satisfies
		the equation:<br><br>
		
		(3) $c_i A_{ij} = &lambda; c_j$<br><br>
		
		This is sometimes called a left eigenvector because it is an eigenvector calculated by multiplying the matrix by a row vector on 
		the left. Now we left multiply the system of ODEs in (1) by the eigenvector $c_i$ and apply equation (3):<br><br>
		
		(4) $c_i {dx_i}/{dt} = c_i A_{ij} x_j = &lambda; c_i x_i$ <br><br>
		
		Since $c_i$ is a vector of constants, we can insert it inside the differential on the left hand side of the equation.<br><br>
		
		(5) ${d(c_i x_i)}/{dt} = &lambda; c_i x_i$ <br><br>
		
		Applying equation (2) we get the decoupled modal ODE:<br><br>
		
		(6) ${dq}/{dt} = &lambda; q$<br><br>
		
		The solution of the modal equation is:<br><br>
		
		$q = C e^{&lambda; t}$<br><br>
		
		<h3>Extending Modal Analysis to Nonlinear Systems</h3>
		
		Unfortunately the approach to decoupling ODEs using eigenvectors does not work for nonlinear systems. The problem occurs in
		step (5) because the eigenvectors of nonlinear system are not constant and cannot be brought inside the derivative, so the
		result is not a decoupled ODE.<br><br>
		
		So, is the a way to extend modal analysis to nonlinear systems? There is, and addressing that question is the purpose of this 
		website. The method discussed on this site applies to linear and nonlinear systems and reduces directly to classical modal
		analysis for linear systems. I refer to this approach as generalized modal analysis or GMA.<br><br>
		
		To generalize modal analysis, we are still interested in a choice of coordinate that decouples the system of ODEs. The following
		are some of the differences from the classical approach.<br><br>
		
		<ol>
		<li>The general rule for change of coordinates in ODEs is the chain rule. Modal analysis will be expressed in terms of the chain rule</li>
		<li>In classical modal analysis, modal equations have the decoupled form ${dq}/{dt} = &lambda; q$. In generalized modal analysis, the
		general form ${dq}/{dt} = h(q)$ will be used, where $h(q)$ is any function of $q$.</li>
		</ol>
		
		<h4>The Chain Rule</h4>
		
		In order to apply the chain rule to a system of ODEs, it is useful to write the system in first order form, where the term on the
		left hand side of the equation is a lone single derivative, and the term on the right contains only state variables:<br><br>
		
		${dx_1}/{dt} = f_1(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br>
		${dx_2}/{dt} = f_2(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br>
		...<br>
		${dx_n}/{dt} = f_n(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$<br><br>
		
		A closely related form that is useful for expressing the chain rule is vector field form, where $&part;/{&part; x_i}$ is used to
		represent a coordinate vector for coordinate $x_i$. The system of ODEs represented in vector field form is:<br><br>
		
		$V &nbsp;=&nbsp; {dx_1}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_1} + {dx_2}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_2} + ... + {dx_n}/{dt} &part;/{&part; x_n} &nbsp;=&nbsp; f_1 &part;/{&part; x_1} + f_2 &part;/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n &part;/{&part; x_n}$<br><br> 
		
		If we define a new coordinate function $q(x_1, x_2, ..., x_n)$, we can apply the chain rule to this coordinate:<br><br>
		
		${dq}/{dt} = V(q) = {dx_1}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + {dx_2}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + {dx_n}/{dt} {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} &nbsp;=&nbsp; f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n}$<br><br>
		
		For modal analysis we combine this with the decoupling condition ${dq}/{dt} = h(q)$.<br><br>
		
		${dq}/{dt} = V(q) = f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} = h(q)$<br>
		$f_1 {&part; q}/{&part; x_1} + f_2 {&part; q}/{&part; x_2} + ... + f_n {&part; q}/{&part; x_n} = h(q)$<br><br>
