		Modal analysis is a powerful tool for analysis of linear systems. The reason that modal analysis is so effective
		for analyzing linear systems is that it is able to transform a system from a form where the systems variables are
		coupled, and changes in one variable can impact other is complex ways, to a simple modal form where system variables
		are independent. When the system is in modal form the solutions, the differential equations are decoupled and can 
		be solved and analyzed independently. In essence, the equation of motion for each mode reduces to the form of a
		simple mass-spring-damper system which is fairly easy to understand.<br><br>
