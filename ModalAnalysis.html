		<h2>Classical Modal Analysis</h2>

		<p>For linear systems, modal analysis is an elegant blend of quantitative and qualitative techniques. It accurately predicts 
		linear system response, but also characterizes the general behavior of the linear system. Modal analysis is built on
		simple idea - find a new coordinate system where the original system has a simpler form that is easier to understand.
		It turns out that for linear systems, where the linear coefficients are constant, there is always a coordinate system
		where the system of ODEs has a simple form called the Jordan cannonical form. In many cases, when coordinates are 
		selected such that the system is in Jordan cannonical form, all of the ODEs in the system are decoupled, which means
		they can be solved and studied independently. In some cases, referred to as degenerate cases, there is a simple
		coupling between some of the ODEs in the system. Only the more common nondegenerate cases are discussed below.</p>

		<p>Modal Analysis the process of finding a new linear coordinate system where the ODEs of the system are decoupled 
		from one another. The new coordinates are called modal coordinates.</p>

		<div class="box-right" style="margin-top: 0em;">
		<h1>Definition</h1>
		<b>Modal Coordinate</b> - A linear function $q(x_1,x_2,...,x_n)$ that when used as a coordinate for a system of ODEs
		results in a decoupled ODE. The ODE will have the linear form ${dq}/{dt} = &lambda; q$.
		</div><!--box-right-->

		<p>For linear systems, the quantitative accuracy of modal analysis comes from the fact that the new modal system is 
		the same as the original system, or in other words no approximation is required. The only difference is the 
		coordinate system that is used. The qualitative understanding comes from the fact that modal analysis converts 
		coupled ODEs that are typically too complex to understand as a whole, because the solutions are intertwined, to a 
		decoupled set of ODEs which are simpler to understand because the modal ODEs can be solved and explored independently.
		The modal solutions can be added (or superimposed) to get the total system response. The power of modal analysis 
		comes from the fact that you can understand the total behavior of the system in terms of the individual behavior of the modes.<p>

		<p>For nonlinear systems, there is often a region around an equilibrium or steady state solution were a linear system
		of ODEs provides a good approximation and modal analysis gives reasonably accurate results. However, there are many 
		cases where a linear approximation misses important trends, and cases where the response grows to the point where 
		nonlinear terms are important, and modal analysis gives poor results. So while modal analysis will remain an 
		important tool for the study of linear and nonlinear systems, there is a need to generalize the approach so that the
		elegant blend of quantitative and qualitative analysis are preserved.</p>

		<h2>Calculating the Modal Equations</h2>

		<h3>First Order Form</h3>

		<p>Before generalizing modal analysis to nonlinear systems, lets take a look at how modal coordinates, which
		decouple a linear system of ODEs, are calculated for linear systems. We will start with a system of ODEs expressed 
		as a matrix in first order form. This is a way of representing the system of ODEs where only first order derivatives
		are part of the system of ODEs. <a href="FirstOrderForm.html">Click here</a> for a discussion of how to convert a 
		system with higher order derivates to first order form. A linear system in first order form, with no forcing terms
		can be written like:</p>
		
		<p>(1)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${dx_i}/{dt} = A_{ij} x_j$</p>
		
		<p>As noted above, in order for modal analysis to work, the value of the coefficients in $A_{ij}$ must not change with $t$. 
		In other words, the coeffients can be constant values, or constant parameters such as a mass or stiffness quantity, but can't
		depend on $t$ (or $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$, since these values change with $t$). We will explain why the coefficients
		can't be dependent on $t$ in the discussion below. The linear modal coordinate function $q$ can be written in the form:</p>
		
		<p>(2)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $q = c_i x_i$ </p>

		<p>where $c_i$ is a vector with values that do not depend on $t$.</p>

		<h4>Example System</h4>

		<p>As an example consider the following system:</p>

		<p>${dx_1}/{dt} = -2 x_1 + x_2$<br>
		   ${dx_2}/{dt} = x_1 - 2 x_2$</p>

		<p>Or in Matrix Form:</p>

		<p>$(\table {dx_1}/{dt}; {dx_2}/{dt}) = (\table -2, 1; 1, -2) (\table x_1; x_2)$</p>

		<p> The modal coordinate function in matrix form is written as:</p>

		<p>(3)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $q = (\table c_1, c_2) (\table x_1; x_2) = c_1 x_1 + c_2 x_2$</p>

		<p>To calculate a modal coordinate of a system of ODEs, we do the following:

		<h3>Step 1 - Calculate an Eigenvector</h3>

		<p>The first step for determining a modal coordinate is to calculate a left eigenvector $c_i$. A left eigenvector 
		a vector that solves the equation:</p>

		<p>(4)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $c_i A_{ij} = &lambda; c_j$</p>

		<p>This is called a left eigenvector because it is an eigenvector calculated by multiplying the matrix $A_{ij}$ by a
		row vector $c_i$ on the left side.</p>

		<h4>Step 1 Example</h4>

		<p>For the example system above the left eigenvector equation is:</p>

		<p>$(\table c_1, c_2) (\table -2, 1; 1, -2) = &lambda; (\table c_1, c_2)$</p>

		<p>The associated algebraic equations are:</p>

		<p><table style="margin-left: 1em"><tr><td align="right">$-2 c_1 + c_2 =$</td><td> $&lambda; c_1$</td></tr>
		   <tr><td align="right">$c_1 - 2 c_2 =$</td><td>$&lambda; c_2$</td></tr></table></p>

		<h4><a name="modes">Modes of the Example System</a></h4>
		<p>The above algebraic equations have two (modal coordinate) solutions which can be found with a little algebra:</p>
		
		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;1</b></div> <div class="pad"></td><td>$&lambda; = -1$ and $(\table c_1, c_2) = (\table s, s)$ where $s$ is a real number. From this we get $q_1 = s x_1 + s x_2$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;2</b></div> <div class="pad"></td><td>$&lambda; = -3$ and $(\table c_1, c_2) = (\table s, -s)$  where $s$ is a real number. From this we get we get $q_2 = s x_1 - s x_2$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>
		</p>
		<p>For modal analysis, the arbitrary constant $s$ is typically set of some specific value such as 1. However, we will just
		keep the constant $s$ below since it helps identify where our modal coordiantes have been substituted.</p>

		<h3>Step 2 - Left Multiply the System of ODEs by the Eigenvector</h3>

		<p>Left multiplying the system of ODEs from equation (1) by the eigenvector $c_i$ and applying the eigenvector
		equation from (4) gives:</p>
		
		<p>(5)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; $c_i {dx_i}/{dt} = c_i A_{ij} x_j = &lambda; c_i x_i$ </p>

		<h4>Step 2 Example</h4>

		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;1</b></div> </td><td>$(\table s, s) (\table {dx_1}/{dt}; {dx_2}/{dt}) = -1 (\table s, s) (\table x_1; x_2)$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;2</b></div> </td><td>$(\table s, -s) (\table {dx_1}/{dt}; {dx_2}/{dt}) = -3 (\table s, -s) (\table x_1; x_2)$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>

		<h3>Step 3 - Bring the Left Hand Side Eigenvector inside the Derivative</h3>

		<p>Since the coefficient in $c_i$ are contant relative to $t$, we can insert $c_i$ into the differential on the 
		left hand side of the equation. This is important because it results in the produce $c_i x_i$ inside the differential,
		which equals $q$ [see equation (2)].</p>

		<p>(6)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${d(c_i x_i)}/{dt} = &lambda; c_i x_i$ </p>

		<h4>Step 3 Example</h4>

		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;1</b></div></td><td> ${d}/{dt} ((\table s, s) (\table x_1; x_2)) = -1 (\table s, s) (\table x_1; x_2)$ &nbsp;&nbsp; &rArr; &nbsp;&nbsp;  ${d}/{dt} (s x_1 + s x_2) = -1 (s x_1 + s x_2)$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;2</b></div></td><td> ${d}/{dt} ((\table s, -s) (\table x_1; x_2)) = -3 (\table s, -s) (\table x_1; x_2)$ &nbsp;&nbsp; &rArr; &nbsp;&nbsp;  ${d}/{dt} (s x_1 - s x_2) = -3 (s x_1 - s x_2)$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>

		<h3>Step 4 - Substitute in the Modal Coordinate</h3>
		
		<p>Both the left and right hand side of equation (6) now contain the product $c_i x_i$. From equation (2) this can
		be replaced by $q$ to get the decoupled modal ODE:</p>
		
		<p>(7)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ${dq}/{dt} = &lambda; q$</p>
		
		<h4><a name="eqn">Step 4 Example - Modal Equations</a></h4>

		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;1</b></div></td><td>${dq_1}/{dt} = -q_1$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;2</b></div></td><td> ${dq_2}/{dt} = -3 q$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>

		<h3>The Solution</h3>

		<p>The solution of the modal equation is $q = C e^{&lambda; t}$ where $C$ is an arbitrary constant determined by
		initial conditions.</p>
		
		<h4>Solution for the Example Problem</h4>

		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;1</b></div></td><td> $q_1 = C_1 e^{-t}$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>
		<table>
		<tr><td><div class="box"><b>Mode&nbsp;2</b></div></td><td> $q_2 = C_2 e^{-3t}$</td></tr>
		</table>
		<hr>

		<h2>Nonlinear Systems</h2>
		
		<p>The modal analysis steps outlined above do not result in a decoupled ODE for nonlinear systems. The problem is 
		that some of the coefficients in the matrix $A_{ij}$ will be functions of $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$. This means the 
		eigenvectors will also depend on these variables. Since $x_1, x_2, ..., x_n$ change with $t$, the eigenvectors 
		$c_i$ have a dependence on $t$, and the process fails at step 3 because a terms that changes with $t$ can't be 
		brought inside the derivative term. Since we can't bring $c_i$ inside the derivative, we don't have the product 
		$c_i x_i$ on the left hand side of the equation, so we can't replace the $c_i$ and $x_i$ with $q$, and the process 
		for decoupling the ODE fails.</p>
		
		<p>So how do we fix this issue for nonlinear systems? Well, it turns out that for linear systems, the step shown above
		are a combination of the <b class="emphasis">chain rule</b> along with a decoupling condition, although this isn't obvious. The chain rule is
		the general rule for applying a change of coordinates to any system of ODEs - linear or nonlinear. <i>The problem is that
		the steps above are not consistent with the chain rule when we are dealing with a nonlinear system.</i> In order to generalize
		modal analysis to nonlinear systems, the change of coordinates and the decoupling condition should be expressed in a form 
		that is consistent with the chain rule.</p>
